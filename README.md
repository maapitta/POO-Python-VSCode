OOP

This repository contains projects developed while studying Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python and the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) IDE. The projects focus on fundamental concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. The repository includes examples of various design patterns and data structures used in Python OOP programming. The projects were developed as part of a learning process to gain a better understanding of OOP and how to apply it in real-world scenarios.

For Project_Module ORM, SQLAlchemy, and the SQLite database were used for database integration, as required.

All files ending in "-test" must be run with the files of the same name.
